// An Introduction

/*

JavaScript is provided and executed as plain text so no preparation or compilation to run, initially made to make web pages active.

It used to have the name LiveScript but they wanted to support Java since it was unpopular at the time so they called it JavaScript.

It evolved into its own independent thing and has its own specification called ECMAScript and has quite literally NO relation to Java at this point


JavaScript can execute in browser ofc, it can also execute on a server or ANY device that hasÂ the JavaScript engine

Browsers have an embedded engine called Javascript virtual machine
- Chrome, Opera, and Edge have the [V8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)) engine
- Firefox has [SpiderMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey) engine
- Safari has some but idc

There will be some features that are supported by some engines and not others so its good to have a general idea for what the engines are
